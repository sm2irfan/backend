### Create an installation instructions file

Let's also create a file with installation instructions for the developers:

### [SQLITE_INSTALLATION.md](file:///home/irfan/StudioProjects/desktop_app/counter/SQLITE_INSTALLATION.md)

```markdown
# SQLite Installation Instructions

This application uses SQLite for local data storage. On desktop platforms, you need to ensure that SQLite libraries are installed.

## Linux

On Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
```

On Fedora/RHEL-based distributions, run:

```bash
sudo dnf install sqlite-devel
```

On Arch Linux, run:

```bash
sudo pacman -S sqlite
```

## Windows

For Windows, the SQLite library is automatically bundled with the application when using `sqflite_common_ffi`.

## macOS

For macOS, the SQLite library is usually pre-installed. If needed, you can install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install sqlite
```

## Verifying Installation

After installing the SQLite library, restart the application. The "Sync All Products table" button should work properly.
```

The changes made:

1. Added a check for SQLite library availability with a method to test if the library exists
2. Added a fallback mechanism to notify users when SQLite is not available
3. Added a function to check if SQLite is installed on the system
4. Updated the sync function to handle SQLite unavailability gracefully
5. Created an installation guide for developers

These changes will provide clear feedback to users about the missing SQLite library and guide them on how to install it.

Made changes.
