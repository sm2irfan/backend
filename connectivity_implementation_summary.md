# Internet Connectivity Check + Product Copy Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added internet connectivity checking **before** any database operations to ensure data consistency between local and cloud storage, plus a new **Product Copy** feature that allows users to duplicate existing products with all their data for easy creation of similar items.

## New Features

### 1. Product Copy Functionality
- **Copy Button**: Added to action buttons alongside Edit and Delete
- **Smart Copying**: 
  - Copies all product data including name, price, description, categories, etc.
  - Automatically appends "(Copy)" to the product name
  - Starts in "Add New Product" mode with pre-filled data
  - User can modify any field before saving
- **User Experience**: 
  - Cancels any existing edit/add operations
  - Scrolls to top to show the copied product form
  - Shows confirmation message
  - Follows same connectivity rules as new product creation

### 2. Enhanced Internet Connectivity Checking
- **Connectivity Check Before Any Save Operation**
- **Keep Edit/Add Mode Active on Connection Issues**
- **User Choice Dialog** when no internet connection is detected

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Dependencies
- Added `connectivity_plus: ^6.0.5` to `pubspec.yaml`

### 2. Created ConnectivityHelper Utility
- **File**: `lib/components/product/connectivity_helper.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Checks device connectivity status
  - Performs actual internet reachability test (ping google.com)
  - Provides user-friendly error dialogs with retry options
  - Includes both dialog and snackbar notification methods

### 3. Modified Save Operations

#### Product Table (`product_table.dart`)
- **BEFORE**: Checked connectivity after local save
- **NOW**: Checks connectivity **before** any save operation
- **Behavior**: If no connection, shows dialog with options:
  - "Try Again Later" - keeps edit mode active
  - "Retry Now" - rechecks connectivity and attempts save
  - "Save Locally Only" - saves to local DB, marks for sync later
- **Edit Mode**: Only exits edit mode when save succeeds (local + cloud OR local-only by choice)

#### Add Product Manager (`add_product_manager.dart`)  
- **BEFORE**: Checked connectivity after creating product object
- **NOW**: Checks connectivity **before** any save operation
- **Behavior**: If no connection, shows dialog with options:
  - "Try Again Later" - keeps add mode active
  - "Retry Now" - rechecks connectivity and attempts save
  - "Save Locally Only" - saves to local DB with warning message
- **Add Mode**: Only exits add mode when save succeeds or user chooses local-only

#### Product Image Editor (`product_image_editor.dart`)
- Modified `_uploadImage()` method to check connectivity before uploading to Supabase storage
- Shows error dialog with retry option if no internet connection

#### Sync Products Button (`sync_products_button.dart`)
- Already had connectivity checking implemented
- Shows error dialog with retry option if no internet connection

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Updated tooltip in `editable_product_manager.dart` to indicate internet requirement
- All connectivity errors show user-friendly messages with retry functionality
- **Data Consistency**: Local and cloud data stay in sync
- **No Lost Work**: Edit/add modes remain active until user decides

## How It Works

### Save Changes Flow:
1. **Validation**: Product data is validated first
2. **Connectivity Check**: Internet connection is verified
3. **If Connected**: Save locally â†’ Sync to cloud â†’ Exit edit mode
4. **If Not Connected**: Show dialog with options:
   - **Try Again Later**: Keep edit mode, user can attempt save later
   - **Retry Now**: Recheck connection and try save process again
   - **Save Locally Only**: Save to local DB, mark for future sync, exit edit mode

### Add New Product Flow:
1. **Validation**: Product data is validated first
2. **Connectivity Check**: Internet connection is verified
3. **If Connected**: Save to cloud (get real ID) â†’ Save locally â†’ Exit add mode
4. **If Not Connected**: Show dialog with options:
   - **Try Again Later**: Keep add mode, user can attempt save later
   - **Retry Now**: Recheck connection and try save process again
   - **Save Locally Only**: Save locally with temp ID, exit add mode

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**: Prevents data drift between local and cloud
2. **Better UX**: Users get clear feedback about connectivity issues
3. **Retry Functionality**: Users can easily retry operations when connection is restored
4. **No Lost Work**: Edit/add sessions persist until user decides what to do
5. **Clear Messaging**: Error messages explain exactly what failed and why
6. **User Choice**: Users can choose to save locally if they don't want to wait

## Testing

To test the connectivity checking:
1. Disconnect from internet
2. Try to save changes to a product or add a new product
3. Should see connectivity error dialog with three options
4. Choose "Try Again Later" - should stay in edit/add mode
5. Reconnect to internet  
6. Click save again - should work normally
7. OR test "Save Locally Only" option to save without cloud sync

## Files Modified
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added connectivity_plus dependency
- `lib/components/product/connectivity_helper.dart` - New utility class
- `lib/components/product/product_table.dart` - Modified save flow + added copy functionality
- `lib/components/product/add_product_manager.dart` - Modified add product flow with connectivity check
- `lib/components/product/product_image_editor.dart` - Added connectivity check to image uploads
- `lib/components/product/sync_products_button.dart` - Already had connectivity checking
- `lib/components/product/editable_product_manager.dart` - Updated tooltip text
- `lib/components/product/product_table_config.dart` - Added copy button to action buttons, increased action column width

## Copy Feature Usage

1. **Find a Product**: Locate the product you want to copy in the table
2. **Click Copy Button**: Click the blue copy icon (ðŸ“„) in the action column
3. **Edit Details**: The product data will be loaded into a new product form
   - Name will have "(Copy)" appended
   - All other fields will be pre-filled with original data
   - Modify any fields as needed
4. **Save**: Click the green save button to create the new product
   - Follows same connectivity rules as new product creation
   - If no internet: get options to retry or save locally

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**: Prevents data drift between local and cloud
2. **Better UX**: Users get clear feedback about connectivity issues
3. **Retry Functionality**: Users can easily retry operations when connection is restored
4. **No Lost Work**: Edit/add sessions persist until user decides what to do
5. **Clear Messaging**: Error messages explain exactly what failed and why
6. **User Choice**: Users can choose to save locally if they don't want to wait
7. **Efficient Product Creation**: Copy feature speeds up creation of similar products
8. **Flexible Workflow**: Copy, edit, and save with full connectivity protection
